# node-grpc-producer
Node Remote Procedure Call producer example, using gRPC package.

> A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol or mechanism that enables a program to execute a procedure (a function or method) on a different address space, typically on another computer in a network. This allows for communication between software components across different systems as if they were local. The main idea is to abstract the complexities of network communication, making the process of calling functions on remote systems appear seamless.
